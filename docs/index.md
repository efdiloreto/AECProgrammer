# Welcome to my AEC Programming Blog!

Hello there! Welcome to my blog, where I aim to bridge the gap between the world of architecture, engineering, and programming. 

My name is Eduardo Di Loreto, and I'm an experienced civil engineer with a passion for programming in Python and C#. Over the past 8 years, I have immersed myself in the exciting realm of software development, focusing on creating powerful plugins and scripts for various industry-leading BIM (Building Information Modeling) and AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) software such as Revit, Rhino, Tekla (I'm the [PyTekla](https://efdiloreto.github.io/PyTekla/) creator), IFC and other structural engineering tools.

### Why I Started This Blog

As an engineer, I understand the importance of efficiency, accuracy, and automation in the design and construction processes. Programming has become an invaluable skill for architects and engineers, and I believe that sharing my knowledge and experiences in Python and C# can empower fellow professionals to embrace coding as a means to optimize their workflows and unleash their creative potential.

### What You'll Find Here

In this blog, you'll find examples on how to code for different softwares using different and real world examples.
